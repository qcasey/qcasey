# I'm Quinn

I'm a generalist software developer. I don't mind programming in different flavors, but lately Iâ€™ve gravitated toward Flutter and ~~Go~~ Javascript. I like mojitos and getting caught in the sun.

I keep an updated list of projects and musings [on my website](https://quinncasey.com/).
